# Apartmentex

Easy SaaS for Phoenix/Ecto.

In this branch, the following versions are supported:
* Ecto 2.0.x
* Postgrex 0.11.0

### Features
* Tenant-qualified queries targeting postgres schemas or MySql databases
* Automatic migrations for tenant tables to schema for Postgres or
database for MySQL

See an example app at https://github.com/Dania02525/widget_saas

### Setup

- Add this to your mix.exs deps:
```elixir
{:apartmentex, "~> 0.2.3"}
```
- Run:
```mix deps.get && mix deps.compile```

- You can also configure your tenant schema prefix, adding this to your application configs:
```elixir
config :apartmentex, schema_prefix: "prefix_" # the default prefix is "tenant_"
```

- If you want to use `mix apartmentex.migrate` below, you also need a schema iterator config like this:
```elixir
config :apartmentex, :schema_iterator,
  repo: MyApp.Repo,
  app_start_needed: true,
  list: quote(do: MyApp.Repo.all(MyApp.Tenant) |> Enum.map(fn x -> x.schema_name end))
```
The :list parameter can be either a list of tenant names or a quoted expression like the one shown.
Your application will be started before evaluating the quoted content if app_start_needed is true.

### Use

Generate a migration file that will be run against each tenant:

```
mix apartmentex.gen.migration CreateUsers
```

By default, the migration will be generated to the
"priv/YOUR_REPO/tenant_migrations" directory of the current application but it
can be configured to be any subdirectory of `priv` by specifying the `:priv` key
under the repository configuration.

You can now add a new tenant and automatically create a new schema for Postgres
users or a new database for MySQL users, and run the migrations in
priv/YOUR_REPO/tenant_migrations for that schema or database.

Table references and indexes in a migration will be applied to the same tenant
prefix as the table within tenant_migrations.

```elixir
Apartmentex.new_tenant(Repo, tenant)
```

When you need to update a tenant's schema based on new migrations, you can run:

```elixir
# Runs all migrations necessary for the tenant, based on that tenant's
`schema_migrations` table
# Returns a tuple that is either:
# {:ok, prefix_of_tenant, versions_migrated}
# {:error, prefix_of_tenant, db_error_message}

{status, prefix, versions_or_error} = Apartmentex.migrate_tenant(Repo, tenant)
```

If there is a problem with a migration, you can roll it back by passing in the
version (as an integer). This will revert every migration back until the version
specified (including that version):

As a convenience, if you need to update all tenant schemas based on new migrations, you can run:
```
mix apartmentex.migrate
```
Note: this requires the schema_iterator config mentioned above.


```elixir
# Returns a tuple that is either:
# {:ok, prefix_of_tenant, versions_rolled_back}
# {:error, prefix_of_tenant, db_error_message}

{status, prefix, versions_or_error} = Apartmentex.migrate_tenant(Repo, tenant, :down, to: 20160711125401)
```

When deleting a tenant, you can also automatically drop their associated schema or database (for MySQL).

```elixir
Apartmentex.drop_tenant(Repo, tenant)
```

Include the tenant struct or tenant id in Apartmentex calls for queries, inserts, updates, and deletes.

```elixir

  widgets = Apartmentex.all(Repo, Widget, tenant)

  Apartmentex.insert(Repo, changeset, tenant)

  Apartmentex.update(Repo, changeset, tenant_id)

  Apartmentex.delete!(Repo, widget, tenant_id)

```

### To Do

- mix task to migrate or rollback all tenant schemas/databases
